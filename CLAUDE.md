## What This Project Is

Penumbra — a bridge between Ableton Live and DMX lighting hardware. An M4L device streams Live session state to a Go server, which handles diff computation, universe partitioning, and E1.31 multicast dispatch to WLED/ESP32 devices. A Vite/React PWA (optionally wrapped in a thin Electron shell) provides monitoring and control.

---

## Architecture

```
Ableton Live + M4L Device
        │
        │  UDP unicast (MessagePack) — full state every tick
        ▼
    Go Server  ──────────────────────── PWA / Electron UI
        │        WebSocket + HTTP        (Vite/React)
        │
        │  E1.31 multicast per universe
        ▼
  WLED ESP32 (universe N)
```

**M4L is a dumb state emitter.** It sends full state every tick with no diff logic, no keyframes, no universe awareness. All intelligence lives in the Go server.

---

## Deployment Modes

The Go server is a single statically-linked binary. No Node/npm runtime required in production.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Local (default)** | Electron spawns Go binary as child process, UI loads `localhost:3000` |
| **Remote** | Electron points UI at remote server URL, skips spawning |
| **Headless** | Go binary runs standalone on Linux/Pi, UI accessed via browser |

In all modes the UI is identical — Vite/React PWA connecting to Go via WebSocket. The Go binary serves the PWA as embedded static files.

---

## Development Topology

The stack is intentionally split so that **Live is never required on a dev machine**. The fake emitter replaces M4L entirely for server, UI, and hardware development.

| Component | Dev machine | Performance machine |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Go server | ✓ | optional |
| Vite UI / Electron | ✓ | optional |
| Fake emitter | ✓ | — |
| WLED hardware | ✓ (optional) | ✓ |
| Ableton Live + M4L | — | ✓ |

**The fake emitter** (`tools/fake-emitter/`) is a first-class development tool, not a workaround. It sends identical UDP MessagePack packets to the Go server at 40ms intervals. The server cannot distinguish it from M4L. This means the entire stack — including real E1.31 output to WLED hardware — is fully exercisable without a Live license.

Current fake emitter modes:
- **Static** — fixed parameter values, tests server/UI plumbing
- **Animated** — sweeps values over time, tests E1.31 output on hardware
- **Scripted** — replays state from a JSON file (future)

**M4L development** (performance machine only, via SSH):
- Edit `device/scripts/src/` locally
- Push to git, pull on performance machine
- `autowatch = 1` reloads the device in Live automatically
- Or: mount `device/scripts/src/` via SSHFS for instant reload without git round-trip

The only thing requiring the performance machine is verifying LOM subscriptions and split-tick behavior in a real Live session. This is a small, stable surface area.

---

## Protocol

See `PROTOCOL.md` for full spec. Key points:

**M4L → Server (UDP, port 7000)**
- Full state every tick (~40ms), MessagePack
- Human-readable parameter names, normalised float values 0.0–1.0
- No diff logic, no seq numbers — server handles all of that
- Session change detected by `session_id` change, no handshake needed

**Server → WLED (E1.31 multicast, port 5568)**
- Go server owns universe partitioning, E1.31 packet construction, multicast dispatch
- Per-universe sequence numbers tracked in server
- Universe → IP mapping in `server/config.json`

**Server ↔ UI (WebSocket, port 3000)**
- WebSocket message types (server → UI): `session`, `state`, `diff`, `status`
- WebSocket message types (UI → server): `hotkey` (forwarded from Electron IPC or keyboard)
- Config updates via REST: `POST /api/config` — JSON body, updates `server/config.json`
- Go serves PWA static bundle on same port via embedded `embed.FS`

**Config update pattern**
- `POST /api/config` with JSON body — updates universe and parameter mapping, persists to `server/config.json`
- The `SetConfigMessage` type in protocol-types is defined but not currently handled over WebSocket

**Hotkey pattern**
- Electron global shortcuts → IPC → renderer synthetic event
- Browser: standard `keydown` → same handler
- Server also accepts `hotkey` over WebSocket for future integrations

## Go Server Conventions

Single binary, statically linked. No external runtime dependencies.

Configuration via env vars: `UDP_PORT=7000`, `WS_PORT=3000`

Universe and parameter mapping loaded from `server/config.json` at startup. Updated via `POST /api/config` and written back to disk. This file is committed to the repo as the default configuration.

The UI bundle (`server/ui/dist/`) is embedded at compile time. `server/ui/fs.go` declares `package ui` with an `embed.FS` that the `api` package imports directly. `server/embed.go` also embeds it into the main package (unused by api; harmless). The Go server serves the UI at `/` and WebSocket at `/ws`.

For headless deployment: `Dockerfile` and `systemd` unit in `server/deploy/`.

Cross-compile for Pi:
```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o ableton-dmx-server ./...
```

## M4L Device Conventions

M4L is intentionally simple. Its only job is to read Live Object Model state and emit it.

- `.amxd` not committed — CI build artifact, published to GitHub Releases on tag
- `device/scripts/dist/` gitignored — never commit compiled output
- `device.maxpat` stays minimal — wiring and UI only

### Architecture

`main.ts` only:
- Sets `autowatch`, `inlets`, `outlets`
- Subscribes to Live Object Model events
- Calls `udpsend` with serialized state
- Delegates to `lib/emitter.ts`

`lib/emitter.ts`:
- Maintains current parameter state map
- Generates `session_id` (UUID v4 via Math.random — no crypto in Max SpiderMonkey); regenerated on track add/delete
- Serializes to MessagePack via `@msgpack/msgpack` (bundled by esbuild) on each tick
- No diff logic, no universe awareness, no E1.31

### Build

```bash
pnpm --filter device-scripts build   # single build
pnpm --filter device-scripts watch   # rebuild on save → Max reloads via autowatch
```

Do not use ES2017+ syntax in any M4L source file (`async/await`, `?.`, `??`, etc.).

`build.mjs` uses `platform: 'neutral'` and must include `mainFields: ['module', 'main']` so that npm packages with non-exports `package.json` fields (like `@msgpack/msgpack`) resolve correctly. Do not remove this.

---

## UI Conventions

Vite/React PWA. Runs identically in browser, as installed PWA, and inside Electron.

- `src/ws/` — WebSocket client, reconnects automatically, dispatches typed messages
- `src/hotkeys/` — hotkey handler registry, accepts events from keyboard, Electron IPC, or WebSocket. **Renderer never checks `window.electron` to decide behavior** — hotkey events are normalized before reaching handlers.
- `src/types/` — TypeScript types matching Go WebSocket wire format. Source of truth is Go structs; keep these in sync manually or via codegen.

PWA manifest and service worker in `public/`. The service worker caches the app shell for offline use.

In dev mode, Vite runs on port 5173 and proxies `/ws` to Go on port 3000:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/ws': { target: 'ws://localhost:3000', ws: true }
  }
}
```

---

## Electron Conventions

Thin shell only. Electron adds exactly three things the browser cannot do:

1. **Global hotkeys** — `globalShortcut.register(...)` fires even when window is not focused
2. **System tray** — menu bar presence, show/hide window
3. **Server lifecycle** — optionally spawns Go binary as child process in local mode

Everything else — data, state, UI — flows through WebSocket to Go, identical to the browser.

`electron/main.ts` structure:
- Create `BrowserWindow`, load `http://localhost:3000` (prod) or `http://localhost:5173` (dev)
- Register global shortcuts, forward to renderer via `ipcRenderer.send('hotkey', key)`
- Optionally spawn Go binary based on config
- Set up tray icon

The renderer handles `ipcRenderer` hotkey events identically to keyboard events — same handler, no Electron-specific code paths.

Electron is packaged separately from the Go binary. The packaged Electron app bundles the Go binary for local mode.

---

## Shared Packages (TypeScript only)

`packages/protocol-types` — WebSocket message types shared between `ui/` and `electron/`. Go structs are the authoritative definition; these types must be kept in sync.

The `packages/e131` and `packages/state` TypeScript packages have been removed — that logic now lives in Go.

---

## Monorepo Tooling

**Package manager:** pnpm workspaces for TypeScript packages (`device/scripts`, `ui`, `electron`, `packages/*`)

**Go:** standard `go` toolchain, managed separately from pnpm.

**Task runner:** [Task](https://taskfile.dev) — required. Install via `brew install go-task`. Replaces Make. All dev, build, test, and release operations go through `Taskfile.yml`.

```bash
task install          # install all deps (pnpm + go mod tidy)
task build            # build all components in parallel
task watch            # watch all components in parallel
task test             # run all tests
task lint             # lint all components
task typecheck        # tsc --noEmit all TS
task ci               # full local CI suite (lint + typecheck + test + build)

task fake             # run fake emitter (animated, localhost)
task fake MODE=static # fixed values
task fake TARGET=192.168.1.50:7000  # remote server

task server:dev       # run Go server with live reload (requires air)
task watch:ui         # run Vite dev server

task pack             # build + pack .amxd
task release:build    # cross-compile Go for all platforms
```

Run `task` with no arguments to list all available tasks with descriptions.
---

## CI / CD

**Every push:** lint → typecheck → TS test → Go vet → Go test → build all

**Tag push `v*`:**
- All CI steps
- Pack `device/scripts/dist/` → `device.amxd`
- Cross-compile Go for mac/linux/arm64
- Build Electron app (bundles Go binary for local mode)
- Publish to GitHub Releases: `.amxd`, Go binaries, Electron app

---

## Versioning

Git tags version the entire system. All components versioned together. Do not tag unless CI is green.

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **M4L as dumb emitter** — no diff logic, no universe awareness, dramatically simpler Max JS
- **Go server owns all intelligence** — diff, E1.31, universe partitioning, session management
- **Go single binary** — statically linked, no runtime, trivial Pi deployment
- **Go embeds UI bundle** — one process serves everything, no separate file server
- **PWA baseline** — full UI in any browser, installable, no Electron required
- **Thin Electron shell** — adds only global hotkeys, tray, and optional server spawn
- **Hotkey system source-agnostic** — same handler for keyboard, Electron IPC, WebSocket
- **Full state every tick** — simple to reason about, LAN bandwidth is not a constraint
- **E1.31 multicast standard addresses** — no universe→IP mapping needed in M4L
- **Per-universe E1.31 seq in Go** — correct per spec, isolated from monitoring concerns

### Split-tick LOM read vs emit

The M4L emitter deliberately splits LOM reads and UDP emission across alternating ticks at 20ms intervals, producing one complete LOM read + one UDP emit per 40ms cycle. DMX output lags the LOM by one tick (20ms maximum).

**Why:**

Max's single-threaded JS scheduler gives each `Task` invocation a fixed time budget. If LOM traversal and MessagePack serialization both happen in the same tick, they compete for that budget and risk pushing subsequent ticks late — destabilizing the 40ms cadence. Separating them means each tick does exactly one thing, runs faster, and the scheduler stays predictable.

It also means the two operations are independently measurable. If timing issues arise it is immediately clear whether the cost is in LOM traversal or serialization.

**The tradeoff:**

DMX output lags Live state by at most one tick — 20ms. For lighting this is imperceptible; human perception of lighting changes is in the 100ms range. This is an acceptable and deliberate tradeoff for scheduler stability.

**Implementation:**

```ts
// Two tasks, same 40ms interval, offset by one tick
const lomTask = new Task(() => { localState = readLOM() })
const emitTask = new Task(() => { send(msgpack(localState)) })
lomTask.interval = 40
emitTask.interval = 40
emitTask.delay = 20  // starts one tick behind lomTask
```

Do not merge these into a single task. The split is intentional.

---

## Known Constraints and Gotchas

- **Max JS runtime is ES6 SpiderMonkey** — no async/await, `?.`, `??`. esbuild target ES6. Test bundled output early.
- **Max `Task` jitter** — tick timing is approximate. Acceptable for lighting.
- **Multicast network support** — managed switch recommended. Some consumer APs block multicast. WLED unicast is a fallback.
- **E1.31 port 5568 is fixed** — not configurable.
- **Go embeds UI at compile time** — rebuild Go binary after UI changes for production. Dev mode uses Vite proxy.
- **Go structs are authoritative for wire format** — `ui/src/types/` must be kept in sync manually. Consider codegen if drift becomes a problem.
- **Electron bundles Go binary** — Electron release build must target the correct Go binary for the platform.

---

## What To Avoid

- Do not add diff logic or universe awareness to M4L — server owns that
- Do not merge LOM read and UDP emit into the same tick — the split is intentional for scheduler stability
- Do not commit `device/scripts/dist/` or any `.amxd`
- Do not use ES2017+ syntax in M4L source
- Do not put Max globals in `lib/` — inject them
- Do not check `window.electron` in the renderer — hotkey events must be normalized
- Do not import Electron APIs in `ui/` — only in `electron/`
- Do not add Node/npm dependencies to `server/` — it is pure Go
- Do not hardcode universe→IP mappings — use `server/config.json`
- Do not add reliability mechanisms to UDP layers
- Do not run `pnpm install` in a subdirectory — always from root
- Do not use npm or yarn — use pnpm
- Do not add tasks to CI that call `task` — CI uses native commands directly to avoid Task as a CI dependency for TS packages
